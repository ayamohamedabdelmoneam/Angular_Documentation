# ðŸ“š [Optional] JavaScript Refresher: Classes, Properties & More

Angular makes heavy use of **classes** â€” a feature supported by vanilla JavaScript  
and **extended by TypeScript** (which adds extra features, as you'll see).

---

## ðŸ§± What is a Class?

A **class** is essentially a **blueprint for objects**.  
Any properties and methods defined in the class will exist on all objects created from it.

### Example in Vanilla JavaScript:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log('Hi, I am ' + this.name);
  }
}
```

### Creating Instances:

```js
const person1 = new Person('Max', 35);
const person2 = new Person('Anna', 32);
```

### Using Properties and Methods:

```js
console.log(person1.age); // 35
person2.greet(); // Hi, I am Anna
```

## ðŸ’¡ Classes in Angular

When using Angular, youâ€™ll often define **classes that you never instantiate manually**.

For example:

```ts
@Component({})
class SomeComponent {}
```

> Components are defined as **classes**,  
> but Angular is responsible for **instantiating** them â€”  
> you never call `new SomeComponent()` yourself.

---

## âœ¨ TypeScript Enhancements

Since Angular uses **TypeScript**, you get extra features like:

### ðŸ”¹ Decorators

Decorators like `@Component` are used to add **metadata & configuration** to classes.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html'
})
class ExampleComponent {}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Access Modifiers

You can control access to class members:

- `public`: accessible from anywhere (default)
- `private`: accessible only within the class
- `protected`: accessible within the class and subclasses

```ts
class Car {
  private engine: string;

  constructor(engine: string) {
    this.engine = engine;
  }
}
```

## âœ… Summary

- Classes are **blueprints for objects**
- Angular defines most building blocks as **classes**
- TypeScript adds powerful enhancements (decorators, access modifiers)
- Youâ€™ll see classes in action **throughout the course**
