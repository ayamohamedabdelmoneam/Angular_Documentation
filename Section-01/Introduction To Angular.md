## ðŸ”¹ What is Angular?

Angular is actually **two things**:

### 1. A Front-End Framework
Angular is a **collection of packages and rules** (a framework) that:

### 2. A Complete Platform
In addition to the core framework, Angular also includes:

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**  
  Useful for:
  - Creating Angular projects
  - Running development servers
  - Generating components, services, and modules quickly

- **Development Tools & Plugins**
  - IDE and code editor plugins (e.g., for VS Code)
  - Debugging tools
  - Code formatting and linting
